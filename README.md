# Daily_Horoscope_Telegram_Bot
This project centers on providing daily horoscope readings to users. Essential to this effort is seamlessly integrating an API with platforms like Zapier for automation and UChat for a smooth workflow.
## Tech stack used:
1.	***UChat*** – It is indeed a platform for designing bots, it's likely intended to help users create and manage chatbots for various purposes, such as customer support, information retrieval, or interaction automation. Many businesses and developers use chatbots to streamline communication and interactions with users. 
2.	***Zapier Platform*** – It is a popular automation tool that allows you to connect various web applications and automate workflows without needing to write code. It enables you to create "Zaps," which are automated workflows that trigger actions in one app based on events in another app.
3.	***Divine API*** - Divine API offers developers to integrate the features of Astrology API to their apps and give their users an enthralling experience to peep into the insights of their present, past and future.

## Entire process:
  ### 1.	Making Integration of Divine API with Zapier

1.	***Create a Zap***: To get started, you would have created a new Zap within your Zapier account.
2.	***Trigger Event***: For your trigger, you would have chosen an event that occurs in Divine API. This event could be something like "New Daily Horoscope Available," "Weekly Horoscope Update," or any other relevant event that you want to use as a trigger.
3.	***Connect to Divine API***: Zapier would have prompted you to connect to the Divine API by providing the necessary API key or authentication credentials. This would allow Zapier to access the data from Divine API.
4.	***Configure Trigger Data***: Depending on the chosen trigger event, you might need to configure the data that Zapier should retrieve from Divine API. This could include parameters like zodiac sign, date, or other relevant information.
5.	***Test Trigger***: After configuring the trigger, you would have tested it to ensure that Zapier can successfully retrieve the desired data from Divine API.
6.	***Set Up Action***: Once the trigger is configured and tested, you would proceed to set up an action. This is what Zapier will do when the trigger event occurs.
7.	***Choose Action App***: For the action, you would select an app that you want to connect with Divine API. This app could be an email service, a messaging platform, a spreadsheet tool, or any other app supported by Zapier.
8.	***Configure Action Data***: Depending on the chosen action app, you would configure how the data from Divine API should be used in the action. For example, if you're sending a daily horoscope to an email address, you'd specify the recipient and the content to include in the email.
9.	***Test Action***: After configuring the action, you would test it to ensure that Zapier can successfully perform the desired action using the data from Divine API.
